SENTENCE: A family of 12 monkeys collected 10 piles of bananas. 6 piles had 9 hands, with each hand having 14 bananas, while the remaining piles had 12 hands, with each hand having 9 bananas. How many bananas would each monkey get if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves?
ANSWER: Let's think step by step. The first 6 bunches had 6x9x14=756 bananas. There were 10-6=4 remaining bunches. The 4 remaining bunches had 4x12x9=432 bananas. All together, there were 756+432=1188 bananas Each monkey would get 1188/12=99 bananas. So the answer is 99.

SENTENCE: Sally and Bob have made plans to go on a trip at the end of the year. They both decide to work as babysitters and save half of what they've earned for their trip. If Sally makes $6 per day and Bob makes $4 per day, how much money will they both have saved for their trip after a year?
ANSWER: Let's think step by step. Saly saves 1/2 * $6/day = 3/day. Since each year have 365 days, the total amount of money Sally will save in a year is $3/day * 365 days/year = 1095/year. Bob saves 1/2 * $4/day = 2/day. The total amount of money Bob will have saved in a year is $2/day * 365 days/year = 730/year In total, Sally and Bob would have saved $730 + $1095 = 1825. So the answer is 1825.
